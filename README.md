## Send Mail
When a user submits the email composition form, we add JavaScript code to actually send the email. Once the email has been sent, we load the userâ€™s sent mailbox.

## Mailbox
When a user visits their Inbox, Sent mailbox, or Archive, we load the appropriate mailbox. When a mailbox is visited, the application first queries the API for the latest emails in that mailbox. If the email is unread, it appears with a white background. If the email has been read, it appears with a gray background.

## View Mail
When a user clicks on an email, the user is taken to a view where they see the content of that email.
